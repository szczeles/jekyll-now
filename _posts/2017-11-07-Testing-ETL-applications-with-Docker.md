title: Testing ETL applications with Docker
excerpt: here here TODO
---

Writing ETL applications is easy. Especially if you use [pyspark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/quick-start.html) and you write the code in [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) as I [used to do](https://www.slideshare.net/MariuszStrzelecki/one-jupyter-to-rule-them-all) in Allegro.

{% highlight python %}
from pyspark.sql.types import *
{% endhighlight %}
